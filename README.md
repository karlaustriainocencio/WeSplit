In this project I've learnt about the basic structure of SwiftUI apps, how to build forms and sections, creating navigation view and navigation bar titles, how to store program  state with the @State property wrapper, how to create user interface controls like TextField and Picker, and how to create views in a loop using ForEach.

This project is check-splitting app that you might use after eating at a restaurant- you enter the cost of your food, select how much of a tip you want to leave, how many people you're with and it will tell you how much each person needs to pay. and I've additionally included the total amount of all the check which includes the original amount plus the tip value, without dividing by the number of people.
